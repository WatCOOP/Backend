## 💡 Inspiration 💡
As incoming University of Waterloo students, we learned that witihin Waterloo’s CO-OP system, waterlooworks, you are locked to applying to 50 companies. Now at first, that might not seem like a problem but after talking to many current students, we realized that it is a huge problem and is one of the most relavent reasons as to why students can't get a CO-OP position. The reason for that is because, students have no realization of some of the companies posted on WaterlooWorks and will only apply to ones they know of. Causing them to miss out on the chances of applying to many jobs and companies they would be interested in, but just never know of them.

## ❓ What it does ❓
WatCOOP allows users to review their CO-OP experience, and read others CO-OP experiences to possibly find some "underrated" companies to work for and hopefully better their methods of finding the 50 companies they are locked to.

Furthermore, WatCOOP allows users to post their interview experience which gives users an idea of what to expect from the company they are applying to.

Moreover, WatCOOP allows users to post their salary which is a highly regarded indicator of a company for many people.
## 🏗️ How we built it 🏗️
- React.js
- Chakra-UI
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
 
## 🚧 Challenges we ran into 🚧
- Finding what students value regarding a CO-OP experience.
    - To fix this, we talked to many mentors who are Waterloo students(huge shoutout to Karl and Eve). Furthermore, also talked to many students and found that they value the idea of having a CO-OP experience. 
- Verifiying Waterloo emails to ensure they are students.
    - To fix this, we decided to check if the email ends with the regular "uwaterloo.ca" domain and verify that email by sending a verification email to the user.

 
## ✅ Accomplishments that we're proud of ✅
- Implemented a review system that allows users to post their CO-OP experience.
- Implemented a software that I will personally try to use next year.

## 💭 What's next for HandsFreeBrowse 💭
Next, we plan to get more feedback on what values people favor within CO-OP, and what they are looking for in a company, to improve our data. Upon doing that, we will try to advertise WatCOOP specifically to first year students, as they tend to have the lowest CO-OP rates and this could be something of use.
